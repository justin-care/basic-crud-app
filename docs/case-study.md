# Basic CRUD App Case Study

## **Overview**
This basic CRUD app is a full-stack application designed to demonstrate core concepts of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. It showcases the integration of a modern frontend with a Go-based backend, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.

---

## **Problem**
The aim was to create a foundational CRUD application that:
- Implements core database interactions (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Demonstrates frontend-backend integration.
- Showcases best practices in deployment and responsive design.

---

## **Solution**
The CRUD app was built using a modern tech stack with an emphasis on simplicity, maintainability, and performance.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: For building an interactive and responsive UI.
  - **TailwindCSS**: For consistent and mobile-friendly styling.
  - **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds.
- **Backend**:
  - **Go**: For a lightweight and efficient REST API.
  - **Fly.io**: For deployment of the backend service.
- **Database**:
  - A lightweight database solution for persistence (exact technology not specified).

### **Features**
1. **Core CRUD Operations**:
   - Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for data records.
2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Tailored for both desktop and mobile devices using TailwindCSS.
3. **Integrated Deployment**:
   - Backend hosted on Fly.io, enabling fast and reliable access.

## **Implementation Details**

### **Frontend**
- Built with React and TailwindCSS for:
  - Dynamic UI updates.
  - Consistent styling across devices.
- Utilizes Axios for API communication with the backend.
- Deployed using Vercel for a reliable frontend hosting solution.

### **Backend**
- Developed in Go, leveraging its:
  - Performance efficiency for handling concurrent API requests.
  - Simplicity in setting up RESTful endpoints.
- Hosted on Fly.io with a `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- Configured using `fly.toml` for streamlined deployment.

### **State Management**
- Utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing application state and API calls.

---

## **Challenges and Solutions**

### 1. **CORS Issues**
**Challenge**: Enabling frontend-backend communication across domains.

**Solution**:
- Implemented CORS middleware in the Go backend to allow requests from the Vercel-deployed frontend.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
**Challenge**: Ensuring the app is user-friendly on all screen sizes.

**Solution**:
- Used TailwindCSS utilities for responsive layout and adaptive components.

### 3. **Deployment Configuration**
**Challenge**: Managing seamless deployment for both frontend and backend.

**Solution**:
- Utilized Fly.io for simple and reliable backend hosting.

## **Impact**
This project highlights the ability to design and implement a full-stack application using modern tools and practices. It:
- Demonstrates the fundamentals of CRUD operations.
- Provides a showcase of frontend-backend integration.
- Serves as a foundation for building more complex applications.
